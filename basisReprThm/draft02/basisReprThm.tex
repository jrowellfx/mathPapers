Most of us think about ``whole numbers'' not too differently from the way
we learned to count by watching Sesame Street,
the difference being that now we can count a little higher.
How we've trained ourselves it's automatic to think that the way
we write a number or say a number \emph{is} the number.

If I say ``I owe you 13 cents'' and I give you one dime and three pennies then 
after thanking me profusely for repaying this staggering debt,
we'll agree that it's settled with those coins equaling 13 pennies. 
We identify the symbol ``13'' very strongly with this particular number - it would 
be tough to get through life in the modern world without such an automatic process
running in our brains. 
This example highlights what this particular symbol ``13'' actually means -
one dime $(1 \times 10)$ plus three pennies $(3 \times 1)$.

Let's look at the number 13 in some alternative ways - it's the 
number of months in a year plus one month;
what I'm suggesting is that there is no need for the symbol ``13'' in order
to think about this particular number of months. Similarly, 13 is this many apples
\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{};
or 13 is the sixth prime number. None of these ways of thinking about the number
13 require that we represent it using the digits 1 and 3 butted up next to each other.

Each number exists independently from any symbol or word that might represent it.
Numbers are an idea - perhaps such a strong idea that the universe wouldn't exist without them!
Anyway, for our purposes whole numbers exist in some abstract realm -
Each number is one whole unit more than the previous number,
starting at nothing, that is ``zero'', and jumping to something, that is ``one'',
then one more, which gets us to ``two'',
then again to ``three'', etc. Continuing in this way forever\dots{} we get them all.

To get back to the idea of what a whole number really is,
try to forget about the symbols or words we use and picture a pile of apples.
There's zero apples (it's hard to show no-apples),
then we introduce an ``\faApple{}" to get our very first,
and smallest, non-empty pile of apples.
Then add another apple to get a pile of ``\faApple{}\faApple{}",
then ``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}",
then ``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}"
then some big pile of
``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\dots{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}"
after we've been adding apples for a while.
Each successively bigger pile of apples corresponds with each successive whole number.

We expand this entire set of whole numbers to include their
negative-counterparts and call this larger set ``integers".
We denote the set of integers with this symbol: $\mathbb{Z}$.
If we only want to talk about positive integers along with zero,
we use this symbol: $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$.

However, using a ``1" followed by a ``3" to represent
``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}"
is VERY handy.  So we use Hindu-Arabic numbers and the positional notation of ``base-ten",
more commonly known as ``decimal", to represent each specific integer.
We slap a ``-" on the front if we need to talk about a negative integer.

Base-ten representation of an integer is far superior to ancient Roman numerals for example.
Try adding two numbers together in ancient Rome, or worse,
multiplying or dividing them.
What's XI times IX? Would you believe me if I told
you it's XCIX? Unless you convert those to Hindu-Arabic numerals to check,
you're just gonna have to trust me.
Truth is - I don't know how to multiply using Roman
numerals - nor did most Romans! Not only that,
but I'll bet that most kids who graduated from Sesame Street
can count higher than any Roman could - as the
Roman system only effectively allowed counting up to 4999.

Using base-ten for us is automatic,
we barely think about it when we're adding numbers or multiplying
them - but it's worth looking carefully at how base-ten
works - so let's examine it from the ground up.

It's useful to have simple symbols to represent each of the integers from one to nine,
namely our familiar 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
which have an interesting history and predate their use in base-ten.

Slightly more modern, but still quite ancient,
is the symbol ``0" for ``zero", originally meaning ``empty".
Zero also predates its use in base-ten but without zero,
base-ten wouldn't be possible.

Base-ten uses the idea of stringing a series of digits together
(a digit being one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, \dots{} 9),
one after the other to be able to represent any whole number.
Let's look at the first two-digit number, that is, ten,
which as you well know looks like this: ``10".
This extra digit on the left tells us how many tens we have and the last,
or rightmost digit says how many additional units to add to it.

So our very first two-digit number 10 means ``one lot of ten - plus zero units".
When we see ``11" - we interpret it to mean ``one lot of ten - plus one unit",
and ``12" is ``one lot of ten - plus two units", etc.
Continuing on; ``20" - we interpret to mean ``two lots of ten,
plus zero units", etc.  up to ``90" meaning ``nine lots of ten,
plus zero units".

Following this line of reasoning since ``10" now means the integer ten,
then ``100" must mean ``ten lots of ten,
plus zero units"- which is exactly what it means.
We have a special word for this number we call it ``one hundred" or ``one lot of a hundred,
plus zero lots of tens, plus zero units".
Similarly ``200" means ``two lots of a hundred, plus zero lots of ten,
plus zero units", etc.

We can keep going by one-hundred until we similarly get to ``1000" or ``ten lots of a hundred,
plus zero lots of ten, plus zero units" otherwise known
as ``a thousand" or more specifically ``one lot of a thousand,
plus zero lots of a hundred, plus zero lots of ten, plus zero units".

It get's a little tedious to be so specific when reading out
a number so our language has developed quite a few verbal shortcuts.
Furthermore it doesn't take long before we run out of fancy names
for these ``powers of ten" like, million, billion, trillion,
zillion etc.  So let's introduce some nice clean mathematical notation
to describe these powers of ten and let's forget the fancy words.

\begin{align*}
100&=10\times10=10^2,\\
1000&= 10\times10\times10=10^3,\\
10000&= 10\times10\times10\times10=10^4,\\
\dots{}\\
\underbrace{10\dots{}000}_\text{k zeros}&= \underbrace{10\times10\times10\times10\times\dots{}\times10}_\text{k 10s}=10^k\\
\end{align*}
The $10^k$ means there are  $k$  10's multiplied together - 
also written as a 1 followed by  $k$  zeros.
The above list shows the cases for $k = 2$, 3 and 4.
Using the $k$  like that is just a way to show that we can pick ANY whole number,
i.e., there is no limit on how big $k$ can be.

The notation of $10^k$ is very handy, in fact it extends to the case when $k=0$ and $k=1$.

So $10^1$ means that there is only one 10 multiplied together, or one ``0" following the ``1",
in other words just the number 10 itself.

How about when $k=0$.
Examining the pattern of how the power $k$ relates to how many zeros follow the ``1"
(eg, $10^1=10$, $10^2=100$, $10^3=1000$,
etc.) then it makes sense that $10^0=1$,
i.e., no zeros follow the ``1", which is exactly right.
Actually any number raised to the 0\textsuperscript{th} power is 1,
but we'll leave that explanation for another time.

Let's look at an example.
Reading the number 46307 out according to our technique we can see
that it's ``four lots of ten-thousand,
plus six lots of a thousand, plus three lots of a hundred,
plus zero lots of ten, plus seven units":

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r r r r c r r}
\phantom  & 4 & $\times$ & 10000 & \phantom & \phantom & 40000\\
+ & 6 & $\times$ & 1000  & \phantom & + & 6000\\
+ & 3 & $\times$ & 100 & \; \; = \; \; & + & 300\\
+ & 0 & $\times$ & 10 & \phantom & + & 00\\
+ & 7 & $\times$ & 1 & \phantom & + & 7\\
\cline{6-7}
\phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & = & 46307
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Written in terms of powers of ten: $46307=4\times10^4+6\times10^3+3\times10^2+0\times10^1+7\times10^0$.

You can think of each digit as being a little dial that controls how many lots
of its corresponding power of ten will contribute to the value of the integer.

Claim: Given that we can use as high as power of ten as we like
and we can string together as LONG A LIST of digits as pleases us,
that means that we can create ANY INTEGER WE WANT no matter how big it is.

That's a pretty tall claim.
How do we know that we can create ALL the nonnegative
integers with this scheme? For example,
how do we know that we didn't miss one? Or how do we know that some string of
digits doesn't represent two different integers? I know it seems silly to ask that,
but attention to these kinds of details is what is referred to as ``rigor"
in Mathematics - it's necessary so we don't end up fooling ourselves or spouting
bullshit - or if we are full of it then it's easy
for other Mathematicians to call us on our nonsense.

We're going to jump into the deep end and make our claim in a careful mathematical way.
Such a careful statement is called a theorem - theorems require proof,
which we're going to do!

\section*{Base-Ten Representation Theorem}

\begin{jprIn1}
Let $n,k\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$. Then every $n$ can be uniquely expressed as follows:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_k10^k+d_{k-1}10^{k-1}+\dots+d_210^2+d_110^1+d_010^0$

for some $k$ such that $0 \le d_i \le 9$ where $d_i,i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \le i \le k$.

Furthermore $d_k\ne0$ except when $n=0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-ten as $d_kd_{k-1}\dots{}d_2d_1d_0$
\end{jprIn1}
\bigskip

A difficulty many folks have with math is the notation - it's
a kind of a language unto itself - like a computer program is a language.
Let's take our theorem statement by statement and turn it into english.

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item ``Let $n,k\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$"

This means we are going to talk about two distinct numbers
that we are labeling $n$ and $k$.
That strange looking $\in$ means ``is an element of" (or ``is a member of")
and is always followed by something that is a ``set".
We talked above about the symbol $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ which
we defined as being the set of nonnegative integers.
So, in other words, $n$ can be one of 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or \dots{} 
any number - no matter how large - and the same goes for $k$.

This might be what it would sound like to read that line out loud:\\
``Let $n$ and $k$ be elements of the set of nonnegative Integers."

\item ``Then every $n$ can be uniquely expressed as follows"

What we are about to say applies to ALL nonnegative integers
and furthermore the expression is going to be unique for each integer.

\item ``$n=d_k10^k+d_{k-1}10^{k-1}+\dots+d_210^2+d_110^1+d_010^0$"

This is the expression in question.  It equates $n$ with a series of multiplications
of some numbers (the $d_i$ terms where $i$ can be any
number from 0 to $k$) times descending powers of 10,
and adds them all together.

It's useful to point out the meaning of our ``$d_0,d_1,d_2,\dots{},d_i,d_k$'' terms.
Mathematical formulas such as this make judicious use of ``subscripts''
when coming up with names for lists of variables or constants.
Subscripts following a letter or symbol, such as $d_0,d_1,d_2,\dots{}$
are a handy way to get a list of variable or constant names that are similar looking to each other,
and is meant to imply that they each fulfill a similar role to each other.
Note here how the value of the subscript on each ``$d$" corresponds to its power of ten,
even in the single digit case when the subscript is 0,
or the highest power case when the subscript is $k$. Please also note that it
isn't necessary that the subscript indices match with the powers, but it seems helpful! 

If we had to read the line out loud it might sound something like this:\\
``$n$ is equal to\dots{} $dee$-$kay$ times ten-to-the-$kay$,
plus $dee$-$kay$-minus-one times ten-to-the-$kay$-minus-one,
plus etc. etc., down to\dots{} $dee$-$two$ times ten-squared,
plus $dee$-$one$ times ten, plus $dee$-$zero$ times one".

\item ``for some $k$ such that $0 \le d_i \le 9$ where $d_i,i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \le i \le k$"

The ``for some $k$" means that each integer $n$ has a specific $k$ associated with it.

It then states that those $d_i$ terms are integers,
and can ONLY take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
Note that our uniqueness claim above means that each
integer $n$ has it's own unique list of $d$'s.

It also is very fastidiously pointing out that the little ``$i$'' we just introduced
in the subscript of the $d$'s is also an integer and can be as small as zero but
only as large as our highest power $k$ - whatever $k$ might be.
This is very picky stuff - like a computer program spelling things out
very precisely so the computer knows exactly what you mean.
(That's right - you are the computer).

Sounding it out might sound like this:\\
``for some $kay$ such that zero is less-than-or-equal-to $dee$-$i$
which is less-than-or-equal-to nine, for each $dee$-$i$ and $i$,
which are integers; also $i$ is between zero and $k$ inclusive"

\item ``Furthermore $d_k\ne0\dots{}$"

This is spelling out one more important fastidious detail.
We want to make sure that the ``most significant $d$", that is,
our $d_k$ that goes along with the highest power $10^k$ is not 0,
in other words it must be one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
This is necessary so that we can get our uniqueness property,
otherwise we could say 13 = 013 = 0000013 which are all the integer 13,
so let's outlaw this uninteresting and annoying possibility.

\item ``\dots{}except when $n=0$"

\dots{}completing that last statement which allows for
one exception to the requirement that the ``most significant digit"
is not allowed to be zero, and that's exactly when the
integer $n$ in question IS zero.

\item ``Definition: $n$ is represented in base-ten as $d_kd_{k-1}\dots{}d_2d_1d_0$"

This is introducing what it means to write the number out in base-ten; that is,
we toss out all the extraneous stuff from our expression in (iii) above,
and string all the ``digits" one after another,
from most significant digit $d_k$ on the left down to least
significant digit $d_0$ on the right.
\end{enumerate}

Before we prove our theorem,
consider that base-ten is not the only base in use these days.
Since the introduction of the EDVAC\footnote{You might be thinking, don't you
mean ENIAC which was eariler? Actually no - the ENIAC
used base-10 accumulators, not binary!} computer, around 1950,
there have been many orders of magnitude more calculations done
in base-two (otherwise known as binary) by computers than have EVER
been done by people in base-ten for the entirety of human history.
(This might even be true if we only count one-day's worth of
binary computer calculations - someone needs to check this.)

Binary-computer logic gates (the building blocks of the modern computer)
can only take one of two states, that is; ``off" or ``on".
We interpret these two states to represent these two numbers: 0 and 1.
By doing so, in the same way that base-ten uses ten numbers 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 for its digits; we can represent integers
in base-two with just the digits 0 and 1.  How is this possible?
Let's find out with an imaginary trip into space.

Consider distant Planet-Nova on which the emergent
intelligent species only have nine fingers.
They have three hands with three fingers each - anyway,
that's why they use base-nine, so they only need the numbers 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for their digits.
So like we Earthlings do for the integer ten,
instead of making up a new symbol for nine,
they use ``10" to represent the integer nine - which
for them means ``One lot of nine, plus zero units".

Similarly on Planet-Ocho, since they only have eight fingers,
then they use base-eight and only use numbers 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for their digits.  For them ``10''
means ``One lot of eight, plus zero units".

On and on past Planet-Gary-Seven, and Planet-Secks, Planet-Penta, \dots{}

Finally we come upon Planet-Claire (well someone
has to come from Planet-Claire,
I know she came from there),
where the poor blighters only have two fingers
so they only use the digits 0 and 1 and base-two,
so for them ``10" means ``one lot of two and zero units".
So on Planet-Claire ``10" means two.
Recall above how we arrived at our 100 in base-ten,
being ``ten lots of ten,
plus zero units" - similarly on Planet-Claire ``100''
in base-two for them means ``Two lots of two plus zero units" in other words,
four! What is ``11" in base-two? Using our technique to
describe the digits we see that it's ``One lot of two, plus one unit",
in other words three.

Here's how they count on Planet-Claire using base-two:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l c r l}
%\phantom  & 4 & $\times$ & 10000 & \phantom & \phantom & 40000\\
base-two & base-ten  & \; \; \; \; & base-two & base-ten\\
0 & 0  & \phantom& (\dots cont)\\
1 & 1  & \phantom& 1101 & 13\\
10 & 2  & \phantom& 1110 & 14\\
11 & 3  & \phantom& 1111 & 15\\
100 & 4  & \phantom& 10000 & 16\\
101 & 5  & \phantom& 10001 & 17\\
110 & 6  & \phantom& \dots{}\\
111 & 7  & \phantom& 11111 & 31\\
1000 & 8  & \phantom& 100000 & 32\\
1001 & 9  & \phantom& \dots{}\\
1010 & 10 & \phantom & 1000000 & 64\\
1011 & 11  & \phantom& 10000000 & 128\\
1100 & 12 (cont\dots)  & \phantom& 100000000 & 256\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note something interesting in the list above - the powers of two,
written in base-two,
resemble our powers of 10 in base-ten! That is:
$1=2^0=1$,
$2=2^1=10$\textsubscript{(base-2)},
$4=2^2=100$\textsubscript{(base-2)},
$8=2^3=1000$\textsubscript{(2)},
$16=2^4=10000$\textsubscript{(2)},
$32=2^5=100000$\textsubscript{(2)},
$64=2^6=1000000$\textsubscript{(2)},
$128=2^7=10000000$\textsubscript{(2)},
$256=2^8=100000000$\textsubscript{(2)},
\dots{}

Let's look at the binary number 11010 for example.
Using our wordy technique to describe the number
we can see that it's ``One lot of sixteen,
plus one lot of eight, plus zero lots of four,
plus one lot of two, plus zero units": 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r r r r c r r l}
\phantom  & 1 & $\times$ & 10000 & \phantom & \phantom & 10000 & (16)\\
+ & 1 & $\times$ & 1000  & \phantom & + & 1000 & (8)\\
+ & 0 & $\times$ & 100 & \; \; = \; \; & + & 000 & \\
+ & 1 & $\times$ & 10 & \phantom & + & 10 & (2)\\
+ & 0 & $\times$ & 1 & \phantom & + & 0\\
\cline{6-8}
\phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & = & 11010 & (26)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Written in terms of powers of two: $11010=1\times2^4+1\times2^3+0\times2^2+1\times2^1+0\times2^0$.

Each digit in base-two can be thought of as a little switch that
turns on or off the contribution of its corresponding power of two.

Claim: Given that the inhabitants of Planet-Claire can use as high a power of two as they like,
and that they can string together as LONG A LIST of binary-digits as pleases them,
that means that they can create ANY INTEGER THEY WANT no matter how big it is.

Sound familiar? Let's restate our theorem for base-ten but rewritten for base-two.

\section*{Base-Two Representation Theorem}

\begin{jprIn1}
Let $n,k\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$. Then every $n$ can be uniquely expressed as follows:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_k2^k+d_{k-1}2^{k-1}+\dots+d_22^2+d_12^1+d_02^0$

for some $k$ such that $0 \le d_i \le 1$ where $d_i,i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \le i \le k$.

Furthermore $d_k\ne0$ except when $n=0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-two as $(d_kd_{k-1}\dots{}d_2d_1d_0)_2$
\end{jprIn1}
\bigskip

Try reading the above out loud in your head,
line by line, item by item, like we did above when
we ``sounded it out" for the base-ten theorem - it's
helpful to turn the ``math-code" into understandable
english and a useful habit to get into when reading mathematical statements.

Before we go on,
I want to introduce a little notation to help avoid confusion.
How do you know what I'm talking about if I just
write ``1000"? Do I mean $10^3$ or $2^3$?
If there is any possibility for confusion we write
the number like this $(1000)_{10}$ 
for the base-ten version meaning one-thousand and $(1000)_2$
for the binary version meaning eight.

As is hinted by the habits of our various alien friends
above it seems that we can use ANY integer greater than
or equal to 2 as a base (base-one doesn't really make
sense - think about it for a while).
In fact computer graphics artists are known
to stumble upon numbers written in hexadecimal (usually relating to specifying a color-channel),
which is base-sixteen.

Base-sixteen introduces some new single-character symbols to the usual numbers 1,
2, thru 9,
to represent the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
Base-sixteen adds the ``digits'' A, B, C, D, E and F where
A\textsubscript{16}=(10)\textsubscript{10},
B\textsubscript{16}=(11)\textsubscript{10},
C\textsubscript{16}=(12)\textsubscript{10},
D\textsubscript{16}=(13)\textsubscript{10},
E\textsubscript{16}=(14)\textsubscript{10},
F\textsubscript{16}=(15)\textsubscript{10}.
So if you see this number (80FB)\textsubscript{16} then
I bet at this point (if you take a little time with a
calculator and a pad of paper and pencil) then you can
figure out that it's (33019)\textsubscript{10}.

Note that if we omit the parentheses and subscript from a number,
it means we're talking about it in base-ten - our ``default" base.
Case in point: the subscripts that we use to denote the base
(like the ``16" in (80FB)\textsubscript{16}) are written in base-ten!

We really need to get on with proving our two theorems above.
But what about proving the ``base-nine" version of the theorem for the aliens on Planet-Nova,
or the ``base-eight" version for the inhabitants of Planet-Ocho?

To cover all bases (pun intended) let's restate our theorem for the general case,
call it ``base-$b$",
where $b$ is any number greater than or equal to two.
If we can prove that theorem,
then we'll automatically get all the cases of specific bases for free.

\section*{Basis Representation Theorem}

\begin{jprIn1}
Let $n,k,b\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ such that $b\ge2$.
Then every $n$ can be uniquely expressed as follows:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0$

for some $k$ such that $0 \le d_i \le (b-1)$ where $d_i,i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \le i \le k$.

Furthermore $d_k\ne0$ except when $n=0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-$b$ as $(d_kd_{k-1}\dots{}d_2d_1d_0)_b$
\end{jprIn1}
\bigskip

As we discussed way up at the top of this essay,
 we think about positive integers as a process that builds them up one by one.
That is, each successive integer is one more than the previous one,
starting at 1, then one more
taking us to 2,
then 3, 4, 5, \dots{}ad infinitum\dots

This idea of stepping one after the other,
beginning at 1 and going forever is called the ``Principle of Mathematical
Induction" and is a basic property of the positive integers.
This principle is more than just a way to generate the set of integers,
it's a way of thinking about properties of the integers.

Suppose that $P(n)$ means that the property $P$ holds
for the number $n$; where $n$ is a positive integer.
Then the principle of mathematical induction states that $P(n)$
is true for ALL positive integers n provided that:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $P(1)$ is true
\item Whenever $P(k)$ is true, $P(k+1)$ is true.
\end{enumerate}

Why would these two conditions show that $P(n)$ is true for all
positive integers? Note that condition ii) only asserts the truth
of $P(k+1)$ under the assumption that $P(k)$ is true.
However if we also know that $P(1)$ is true then condition ii) implies that $P(2)$ is true,
which again implies that $P(3)$ is true,
which in turn leads to the truth of $P(4)$,
etc., over and over for all positive integers.

Some people picture an infinite row of dominoes.
Having condition i) (called the ``base case") is like being
able to knock over the first domino.
Then knowing condition ii) is also true is like the
fact that any one domino has the ability to knock over the next.
Once you've knocked over the first domino,
they all fall.

Let's look at a simple example:
Perhaps you've heard the story of young Carl Friedrich Gauss
as a young boy in
the 1780s who was assigned (along with all his classmates)
the tedious task of summing the first 100 integers -
Presumably to keep them quiet and busy while the
teacher corrected some papers.  Anyway,
young Gauss immediately produced the answer
5050, before most of the boys had summed the first couple of numbers.
It wasn't young Gauss's extraordinary computational speed which allowed
him to perform this dazzling task,
but he had the deeper insight that instead of adding 1 plus 2,
then adding 3, then 4, etc.
he saw that if you paired 1 with 100,
and 2 with 99,
and 3 with 98,
etc.,
that each of those pairs added up to 101,
furthermore he knew he'd have 50 such pairs,
meaning he could state the result in a heartbeat ``5050".
Gauss is widely regarded as being one of the greatest
mathematicians who has ever lived - the young eight-year old was just getting started.

\break
Anyway,
to generalize Gauss's insight we can write the expression like this:

\[1+2+3+\ldots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\]

So let's prove this relationship using the principle of mathematical induction.
\bigskip

Let $n=1$ for the ``base case'',
then

\[\frac{1(1+1)}{2}=\frac{2}{2}=1\]

%\hspace{3em}
Which is the trivial sum of the first positive integer 1.
\bigskip

Now let's assume the relationship is true for n,
and prove that it must also be true for n+1:

\begin{align*}
(1+2+3+\ldots+n) + (n+1) &=  \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1)\\
&= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{2(n+1)}{2}\\
&= \frac{n^2+n+2n+2}{2}\\
&= \frac{n^2+3n+2}{2}\\
&= \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\
\end{align*}

Which proves young Gauss's expression is true for the positive integer $n+1$ whenever it's true for $n$ - then
by the principle of mathematical induction, the expression is true for all positive integers.
\bigskip

We are going to use the principle of mathematical induction to prove the Basis Representation Theorem.

First we will prove that there is such a representation for all integers $n$ (existence proof).
Meaning that every integer has a way of being written in the form described by the theorem - especially as relates to the restrictions on the values that the ``digits" can take on.
After that has been established we will use another technique to prove that each such representation is unique - in other words there aren't two (or more) ways to represent the same integer in base-$b$.

\section*{Existence Proof of the Basis Representation Theorem}

Base case:
Let’s prove both $n=0$ and $n=1$ to start us off.

Let $n=0$.

\begin{jprIn1}
We can choose $k=0$ and $d_0=0$.
(This is the one exception spelled out in the theorem in which the most significant digit of n is allowed to be zero.) Then,
\[n=d_0b^0=0\times{}b^0=0\]
showing that we have a valid representation for 0 in base-$b$ since our only digit\\
$d_0=0\le(b-1)$, for all $b\ge2$.
\end{jprIn1}

Now Let $n=1$.

\begin{jprIn1}
In this case,
we can choose $k=0$ and $d_0=1$.
Then,

\[n=d_0b^0=1\times{}b^0=1\times{}1=1\]

showing that we have a valid representation for 1 in base-$b$ since\\
$d_0=1\le(b-1), \forall{} b\ge2$.
\end{jprIn1}

Induction Case:
Assume the theorem is true for $n$;
prove it must also be true for $n+1$:
\bigskip

Assume that $n$ has a valid representation in base-$b$.
That is,
we assume that n can be written thus: 
n=dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0
with all the appropriate conditions holding for the values of diand b and k; and we will prove thatn+1also has a valid representation in base-b.

We’re going to break this step into two cases which between the two covers all possibilities.

Case 1) 0d0(b-2)
This case looks at the situation where the least significant digit of n is strictly-less-than the LARGEST value it can take in base-b.

For example,
in base-two,
d0 can only be 0.
In base-five,
d0can be at most 3.
In base-ten,
d0 can be at most 8,
etc.

So we can express n+1as follows: 
n+1 =(dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0)+1
= dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0+11
= dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0+1b0
= dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+(d0+1)b0
and since d0(b-2)(our assumption for ``case 1"),
then 
(d0+1)(b-2)+1(b-1),
therefore the ``least significant digit" (i.
e.
(d0+1)which corresponds the lowest powerb0) of n+1 is less than or equal to(b-1),
which means it is a valid digit in base-b.

Since all other diterms (i.
e.
d1,d2,?,dk) for n+1are unchanged from their representations for n and n is assumed to be a valid representation in base-b then all the digits of n+1are valid in base-b.

Therefore we’ve established the truth of ``Case 1" for the integer n+1.

Case 2) d0=(b-1) 
Now we’ll look at the case when the least significant digit of n is equal to the largest value it can take in base-b,
that is,
d0=(b-1).
(Note that between ``Case 2" here and ``Case 1" above,
we’re covering all the possibilities for what d0 can be.
)
For example in base-two,
d0=1; in base 5,
d0=4; in base-ten d0=9,
etc.

Let’s temporarily introduce a new digit,
dk+1=0 to our representation of n.
The motivation being that in the situation where we’re adding 1 to 999,
that we need another ``digit" to ``carry" the 1 over into so that we can get 1000.

n =dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0 (definition of n)
=0+dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0 (add zero)
=0bk+1+dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0 (multiply bk+1by zero)
=dk+1bk+1+dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0 (subst dk+1for zero)
Also,
let jZ0be the lowest power of b such that dj<(b-1),
meaning we can write n as follows:
n =dk+1bk+1+?+djbj+(b-1)bj-1+?+(b-1)b1+(b-1)b0
For example,
if n=69412999,
then j=3,
since 103is the lowest power of 10 such that its digit d3=2 is less than 9.

n =dk+1bk+1+?+djbj+(b-1)bj-1+?+(b-1)b1+(b-1)b0
= dk+1bk+1+?+djbj+(bj-bj-1)+?+(b2-b1)+(b1-b0)
= dk+1bk+1+?+djbj+bj+(-bj-1+bj-1)+?+(-b2+b2)+(-b1+b1)-b0
= dk+1bk+1+?+(dj+1)bj-b0
= dk+1bk+1+?+(dj+1)bj-1
Therefore
n+1 =dk+1bk+1+?+(dj+1)bj-1+1
= dk+1bk+1+?+(dj+1)bj
Since we picked j such that dj<(b-1),
less restate the inequality as dj(b-2)therefore,
(dj+1)(b-2)+1(b-1),
meaning the digit (dj+1) for the base-b representation of n+1is valid for base-b.

All digits dj+1and higher remain unchanged from what they were for the base-b representation of n,
and all digits dj-1and lower are 0.
Therefore all the digits of the base-b representation of n+1are valid in base-b.

To cleanly button this up we note that if we were dealing with the case that j=k+1,
(eg.
n was something like 99999) then we can see that n+1=bk+1because:
n+1 =(dj+1)bj
=(dk+1+1)bk+1
=(0+1)bk+1
=bk+1
Meaning that n+1has a (k+1)st digit and it’s equal to 1,
with all the rest of the digits following being 0.

In all other cases (i.
e.
; j< (k+1)) we discard the extra ``temporary" digit dk+1=0 that we created from our expression,
and are left with an expression for n+1 that valid for base-b.

QED - existence proof

Uniqueness Proof:
Suppose n is not unique and that,
n=dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0,

also suppose,
n=ckbk+ck-1bk-1+?+c2b2+c1b1+c0b0
Let’s further suppose that the index j is the first power such that the digits djcjand without any loss of generality,
let’s assume that dj>cj.

Therefore:
ckbk+ck-1bk-1+?+c2b2+c1b1+c0b0=dkbk+dk-1bk-1+?+d2b2+d1b1+d0b0
if and only if,
0=(dk-ck)bk+(dk-1-ck-1)bk-1+?+(dj-cj)bj
