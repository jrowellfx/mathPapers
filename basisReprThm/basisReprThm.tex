What does ``10'' mean?

We got it drilled into us watching Sesame Street that ``10'' is the symbol for the number
``\href{https://youtu.be/YcRBEqq-tGY?list=PLjBV4gvZoIcwHfhAWBmP6i7vEuqU6Q6vE}{ten}''
which is this many apples
``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}''
or the number of fingers on a typical person's two hands.

Once we are trained to think
of ``10'' as representing ten things, we quickly move past it to learn the meaning of ``100'' and ``1000''
and how to interpret a string of decimal-digits 
like ``92507''. Even at a young age we'd
be able to accurately count out a pile of
ninety-two-thousand-five-hundred-and-seven apples, as time-consuming and agonizing as it might be.
Furthermore, learning how to add and multiply is easy once you can count in
decimal since the techniques are simple and straight-forward.

What about kids in ancient Rome, was it as easy for them?
Try adding two numbers together in ancient Rome, or worse,
multiplying or dividing them.
What's XI times IX? Would you believe me if I told
you it's XCIX?

Unless you convert those to decimal (or base-ten) numbers to check,
you're just gonna have to trust me.
Truth is - I don't know how to multiply using Roman
numerals - nor did most Romans. Not only that,
but I'll bet that most modern eight-year-olds 
can count higher than any Roman could - as the
Roman system only effectively allowed counting up to 4999.

Even though we
use different symbols
than
the ancient Romans, we are all
talking about the same abstract set of numbers underneath,
which are called integers\footnote{Integers are 
the set of all the positive whole numbers, as well as zero and all the negative counterparts to each positive number.
%We denote the set of integers with this symbol: $\mathbb{Z}$.
}.
Mathematics deals with numbers in a pure sort of way, divorced from specific symbols
used to represent a given number.
When we talk about positive integers in mathematics
we're really talking about different sized piles of apples.
Each successive integer
represents a successively larger piles of apples. In fact sometimes (when thinking about mathy-stuff)
it's helpful to try to forget about the specific symbols
we use like ``9'' and ``10'' or ``IX'' and ``X'' and think about each integer as a specific sized pile
of apples.

\emph{However}, we use numbers written out with decimal notation all the time in mathematics,
rarely thinking in terms of piles of apples.
We take for granted
that we can use decimal-numbers to represent the set of positive integers,
but, we should be careful about what we take for granted as the 
only ideas that modern-mathematics
takes for granted are axioms.
The fact that we can use decimal-numbers to represent the integers is NOT among the list of axioms.

Briefly; the axioms describe a few simple properties about addition and multiplication.
These properties are \emph{so simple} that they can't be expressed in
yet other even-simpler ideas. The axioms are the minimal set of simple,
obvious, irrefutable ideas from which
everything else in mathematics is built\footnote{The axioms:
For every integer $a,b\text{ and }c$:
Associativity: $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $a(bc)=(ab)c$;
Commutativity: $a+b=b+a$ and $ab=ba$;
Distributive: $a(b+c)=(b+c)a=ab+ac$;
Identities: There are integers 0 and 1 ($0\ne1$) such that,
$a+0=0+a=a$ and $a\cdot{}1=1\cdot{}a=a$ and
Additive Inverse: $a+(-a)=0$.
Note: in general integers do NOT have multiplicative inverses 
that are also integers. (eg. $\frac{1}{2}$ is the multiplicative
inverse of 2 because $\frac{1}{2}\cdot{}2=1$ but $\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer.)}.

Since our ability to count in decimal is not axiomatic, then to properly ground it we should
define what it means to write out a number in decimal,
state its properties in a theorem,
then provide a proof of that theorem;
The proof being
a series of arguments that logically connects it
directly\footnote{directly \dots{}or indirectly
via other previously proven theorems.} to the axioms. 
In doing so, the only way
that the theorem could be false is if the axioms themselves are false.

Here's what that theorem looks like.
\section*{Basis Representation Theorem}
\begin{jprIn}
Let $b$ be a positive integer greater than 1.

For every positive integer $n$ there is a unique sequence
of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0$,

where $0\le{}d_i<b$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-$b$ by the string
of base-$b$-digits $(d_kd_{k-1}{\cdots}d_2d_1d_0)_b$
\end{jprIn}
\bigskip

``That's nuts!'' you might say, I don't even see a ``ten'' in there so how could that
describe how we learned to count in decimal watching Sesame Street? 
If you're unfamiliar with mathematical notation then that stuff above likely probably looks
like nonsense.

Try this: imagine that the above was 
written such that
we replace the $b$ with ``ten''. Does it make any more sense?
At least then we'd have the ``Base-Ten Representation Theorem''. We could also let $b=2$,
which would give us the 
``Base-Two Representation Theorem'' stating how we count in \emph{binary}.

Anyway, don't worry if you can't read the theorem, we'll get to how to do that shortly, but
this theorem is a good example of the kind of thing mathematicians like to do - generalize ideas.

Why restrict ourselves to ten when the idea applies equally well to two, three, four, five, ... etc.?
The heptapods in ``Arrival'' have  seven limbs with seven fingers each, perhaps they
use base-forty-nine, so our
theorem should cover that case too.  By generalizing the idea to a base $b$,
where $b$ is any number two or higher (base-one doesn't really make sense
- think about it for a while\footnote{Is base-one essentially a pile of apples?}),
we gain a deeper understanding of the subject in question.

%Even though doing arithmetic in base-ten
%has been going on for almost two-thousand
%years, formalizing it and generalizing it into a theorem is fairly modern.
%The earliest reference I've found to our theorem
%is in ``Elementary Number Theory'' by E. Landau in 1958.
%We probably don't need to look further back than
%Leibniz time when he introduced the idea of binary
%arithmetic in 1679. So our theorem is fairly recent 
%on the world stage.

%Anyway, if you're not a ``math-person'' don't fear, by the end of this paper you will know
%how to read the ``Basis Representation Theorem'' above so that it makes sense
%plus you'll know how to prove it.

Assuming you want to be able to make sense of and read our theorem, then let's take a step
back and work up to its statement,
using our familiar base-ten for discussion.

When using an arbitrary base (i.e.; base-$b$) to count with,
it's useful to have simple symbols to represent each of the integers from zero to up to $(b-1)$.
So in our base-ten system we use the
digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

Base-ten strings a series of these digits together
one after the other to be able to represent each positive integer.
Let's look at the first two-digit-number: ``10'' (ten).
This extra digit on the left tells us how many sets of ten we have and the last,
or rightmost digit says how many additional units to add to it.

So our very first two-digit-number ``10'' means ``one set of ten - plus zero units''.
When we see ``11'' - we interpret it to mean ``one set of ten - plus one unit'',
and ``12'' is ``one set of ten - plus two units'', etc.

Continuing on; ``20'' - we interpret to mean ``two sets of ten,
plus zero units'', etc. up to ``90'' meaning ``nine sets of ten,
plus zero units''.

Following this line of reasoning since ``10'' now means the integer ten,
then ``100'' must mean ``ten sets of ten,
plus zero units''- which is exactly what it means.
We have a special word for this number we call it ``one-hundred'' or ``one set of a hundred,
plus zero sets of tens, plus zero units''.
Similarly ``200'' means ``two sets of a hundred, plus zero sets of ten,
plus zero units'', etc.

We can keep going by one-hundred until we similarly get to ``1000'' or ``ten sets of a hundred,
plus zero sets of ten, plus zero units'' otherwise known
as ``a thousand'' or ``one set of a thousand, plus zero ...etc''.

It gets a little tedious to be so specific when reading out
a number so our language has developed quite a few verbal shortcuts.
Furthermore, it doesn't take long before we run out of fancy names
for these ``powers-of-ten'' like, million, billion, trillion,
zillion etc. So let's introduce some nice clean mathematical notation
to describe these powers-of-ten and let's forget the fancy words.
\begin{align*}
100&=10\times10=10^2,\\
1000&= 10\times10\times10=10^3,\\
10000&= 10\times10\times10\times10=10^4,\\
\dots{}\\
\underbrace{10\dots{}000}_\text{k zeros}&=
\underbrace{10\times10\times10\times10\times\dots{}\times10}_\text{k 10s}=10^k
\end{align*}
$10^k$ means there are $k$ tens multiplied together - 
also written as a 1 followed by $k$ zeros\footnote{$k$ is called the ``exponent'' and you should
read the symbol $10^k$ as ``ten-raised-to-the-$k$\textsuperscript{th}-power'' or ``ten-to-the-k'',
so $10^2$ is ``ten raised to the second power'' or $10^4$ is ``ten-to-the-fourth''.
You may also see $10^2$ referred to as ``ten squared'',
similarly $10^3$ as ``ten cubed'' - but since we 
don't live in 4-dimensional hyperspace,
we don't have a way of saying $10^4$ that has geometric meaning.}.
The above list explicitly shows the cases for $k = 2, 3$ and $4$.
Using the $k$ like that is just a way to show that we can pick ANY whole number,
i.e., there is no limit on how big $k$ can be.

The notation of $10^k$ is handy and extends
to the case when $k=0$ and $k=1$.
%\footnote{$10^k$ also extends to the cases
%when $k$ is negative as in $10^{-1}$, or $10^{-2}$, etc.
%which means $\frac{1}{10}$ and $\frac{1}{100}$ respectively
%but those are called ``rational numbers''. We aren't concerning
%ourselves with rational numbers in this paper.}

So $10^1$ means\footnote{Don't forget to read $10^1$
as ``ten-to-the-one''.} that there is only one ten multiplied together,
or one ``0'' following the ``1'',
in other words, just the number ten itself.

\break
How about when $k=0$?
Examining the pattern of how the power $k$ relates to how many zeros follow the ``1''
(eg, $10^1=10$, $10^2=100$, $10^3=1000$,
etc.) then it must be the case that $10^0=1$,
i.e., no zeros follow the ``1'', which is exactly right.
Furthermore every number raised to the 0\textsuperscript{th}
power~is~1.\footnote{Proof: Since $a^{b+c}=a^ba^c$ consider when $c=0$; that is,
$a^b=a^{b+0}=a^ba^0$ so because of the uniqueness
of the multiplicative-identity ``1'' (the uniqueness of 1
is a theorem and \emph{not} an axiom) then $a^0$ \emph{must} be 1 since it's behaving 
like a 1 in the expression $a^b=a^ba^0$.}

Let's look at an example.
Reading the number 92507 out according to our wordy technique above we can see
that it's ``nine sets of ten-thousand,
plus two sets of a thousand, plus five sets of a hundred,
plus zero sets of ten, plus seven units'':

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r r r r c r r}
\phantom & 9 & $\times$ & 10000 & \phantom & \phantom & 90000\\
+ & 2 & $\times$ & 1000 & \phantom & + & 2000\\
+ & 5 & $\times$ & 100 & \; \; \; = \; \; \; & + & 500\\

\cline{6-7}
\phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & = & 92507
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Written\footnote{Recall the mnemonic ``bedmas'' for
the ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations}{Order of Operations}'' in
evaluating an expression, which is no different from
what we did in our table above the expression.}
in terms of powers-of-ten:
$92507=9{\times{}}10^4+2{\times{}}10^3+5{\times{}}10^2+0{\times{}}10^1+7{\times{}}10^0$.

This way of breaking down the base-ten representation of a number into
an algebraic expression can be done for EVERY string of decimal digits. It's the key to 
understanding what a string of decimal digits means.

Recalling that $10^0 = 1$ you might wonder why we bother to multiply
$7{\times{}}10^0=7{\times{}}1=7$ since there is no actual effect
when multiplying by one.
Even though it's not necessary, including the $10^0$ in the
expression reveals a kind of mathematical symmetry.
Each successive digit is multiplied by an ever
decreasing power-of-ten, including
the units-digit,
which is just some number from 0 to 9 times a power-of-ten
like any of the other digits.

Our example number 92507 only has five digits and it's biggest power-of-ten is $10^4$,
but there's
no limit on how big a power-of-ten could be involved in our expression.
Look at ``a trillion and one'', i.e.; 1,000,000,000,001 which can be expressed as:
\[1{\times{}}10^{12}
+0{\times{}}10^{11}
+0{\times{}}10^{10}
+\cdots{}
+0{\times{}}10^{2}
+0{\times{}}10^{1}
+1{\times{}}10^{0}\]
%
Or pushing that limit to silly heights we can also describe this next ludicrous number.
It's twenty-thousand-and-one digits long\footnote{A twenty-thousand-and-one digit long number is 
\emph{ridiculously} large,
consider that our estimate of the number of molecules in
the entire universe would only need a base-ten
number with the $k$ set to somewhere between 78 and 82 to count them all.}, a
``7'' followed by 9999 zeros, then a ``3''
followed by 9999 more zeros, then a ``5'', which means this:
\[7{\times{}}10^{20000}
+0{\times{}}10^{19999}
+\cdots{}
+0{\times{}}10^{10001}
+3{\times{}}10^{10000}
+0{\times{}}10^{9999}
+\cdots{}
+0{\times{}}10^{1}
+5{\times{}}10^{0}\]
Clearly we can keep going as high as we like.

Let's use our understanding of counting in base-ten to build up to the
``Basis Representation Theorem'' introduced above.

We intuitively know that counting with
base-ten covers all the positive integers.
For example, the odometer in your car that keeps churning out
new numbers for each mile you drive, starting from zero when it rolls
off the production line.  If your odometer was long enough that it 
stretched off past the horizon on your left, there's no limit on
how many miles you could count.

Our intuition is good - let's write it down
in our theorem. We might say:

\emph{Base-Ten Representation Theorem (initial draft)}
\begin{jprIn}
Every integer has a representation in base-ten.
\end{jprIn}

%\bigskip
Something else we know intuitively is that each number written
in base-ten represents only ONE integer. That is, there aren't two different
sized piles of apples represented by the same decimal-number. Similarly there
isn't one pile of apples that's represented by two \emph{different} decimal-numbers.

% It almost feels silly to spell it out, but if we were to count out
% 4 piles of 100-apples-each-pile, then 7 piles of 10-apples-each-pile,
% then count out 9 additional apples, \emph{then}
% scoop them all into a big pile that
% we'd always get the exact same size big-pile-of-apples.
% 
% It goes the other way too. If we were handed the aforementioned
% big-pile-of-apples we could start counting out
% piles of 100. We'd try to make as many piles of 100 as we could,
% and we'd find that we'd have 4 piles of 100 before
% we couldn't make another such pile.
% Then we would start counting out piles of 10 with the remaining apples finding
% that we could only make seven such piles-of-ten, leaving nine single apples remaining,
% in other words, 479 apples! There is NO other
% way to divvy up this big-pile-of-apples
% if we follow this procedure.  In other words, each integer is
% represented by only ONE base-ten number.

Let's strengthen our theorem based on the last two observations.

\emph{Base-Ten Representation Theorem (second draft)}
\begin{jprIn}
Every integer has a \emph{unique} representation in base-ten.
\end{jprIn}

%\bigskip
%We can also restrict our theorem to positive integers, because
%we know that for every positive integer
%there exists a unique negative integer
%(such that if you add them together you get zero).
%So if we can prove the
%Base-Ten Representation Theorem for the positive integers then we
%can easily extend it to the negative integers (and zero) with a corollary.
%Our corollary could say something like ``Slap a `-' (minus)
%sign in front of the positive base-ten representation to 
%get a unique representation for
%it's negative counterpart'' \dots{}or some such words.

Let's not worry about negative integers for now,
they're easy to represent once you have a way to represent
positive integers, just slap a minus sign on the front to get the negatives.
%So let's make our lives easier and forget about them for the time being.
Also, moving forward it would be helpful to have a name for our 
positive integer so that we can refer to it directly - how about $n$ for ``number'':

\emph{Base-Ten Representation Theorem (third draft)}
\begin{jprIn}
Every \emph{positive} integer $n$ has a unique representation in base-ten.
\end{jprIn}

At the moment it's not very helpful to have named $n$ (the theorem as it stands
doesn't say anything more about $n$ so why did we bother naming it?) but
as we flesh out the remaining details of the theorem
we can refer to $n$ which carries the important information that it could be ANY positive integer.

Earlier we looked at the number 92507 by adding up
each digit times a power-of-ten\footnote{It's time
to replace our ``$\times{}$'' symbol for multiplication, with ``$\cdot{}$''
because ``$\times{}$'' might get confused for an ``$x$'' in an expression,
whereas ``$\cdot{}$'' never will be. Eg. $x\times{}2$
vs. $x\cdot{}2$, additionally ending up with something that is more aesthetically pleasing.
You may also see the ``$\cdot$'' omitted entirely as
in $ab$ - which means $a\cdot{}b$ as you have seen in earlier footnotes.}:
\[92507=9{\cdot}10^4+2{\cdot}10^3+5{\cdot}10^2+0{\cdot}10^1+7{\cdot}10^0\]
\emph{Every} base-ten number implicitly describes an algebraic expression like this, so
let's come up
with a general expression of this form that can describe ANY positive integer $n$.

Let's replace one of the digits in our example number 92507 with $d$, how about the 5 like this $92d07$. What I
mean becomes clear if I write it out:
\[n=92d07=9{\cdot}10^4+2{\cdot}10^3+d{\cdot}10^2+0{\cdot}10^1+7{\cdot}10^0\]
So $n$ is one of the following numbers:
92007,
92107,
92207,
92307,
92407,
92507,
92607,
92707,
92807 or
92907.

The digit $d$ must be an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive 
which we can write as ``$0\le{}d\le{}9$'' however, I suggest that ``$0\le{}d<10$'' is better\footnote{Read 
$0\le{}d\le{}9$ as ``zero is less-than-or-equal-to dee which is less-than-or-equal-to nine''
and $0\le{}d<10$ as ``zero is less-than-or-equal-to dee which is (strictly) less-than ten''.}.
It's logically equivalent to ``$0\le{}d\le{}9$''  but conveys more important information
to the reader. Why even talk about nine when the theorem is about base TEN?
\begin{align*}
n =\ &9{\cdot}10^4+2{\cdot}10^3+d{\cdot}10^2+0{\cdot}10^1+7{\cdot}10^0,\text{ where}\\
&d\text{ is an integer such that }0\le{}d<10
\end{align*}
This statement for $n$ only represents the integers 92007, 92107, \dots{} or 92907, so let's come up
with a statement for $n$ that will allow us to generate ANY five-digit-number from 10000 
the way up to 99999 (which is a complete list of all the five-digit-numbers).

In order to describe this general five-digit-number, we need
five different `$d$'s, one for each of the five digits.
In other words, we need to associate a different term $d$ with each of the powers
$10^4$, $10^3$, $10^2$, $10^1$ and $10^0$.

Mathematics has a convention for coming up with
a list of terms for situations just like this -
we tack a subscript onto the name like so: $d_2$ which
you read as ``dee-two''\footnote{\dots{}yes like artoo-detoo, which perhaps
George should have written ``$R_2D_2$'' and not ``R2-D2''!}.
$d_2$ is a term to represent a digit just like the $d$ we used above.
But now we can use that little subscript as a way to
associate it to a specific power-of-ten.
Naturally, we'll associate $d_2$ with $10^2$ (ten squared) as follows:
\begin{align*}
n =\ &9{\cdot}10^4+2{\cdot}10^3+d_2{\cdot}10^2+0{\cdot}10^1+7{\cdot}10^0,\text{ where}\\
&d_2\text{ is an integer such that }0\le{}d_2<10
\end{align*}
If we define $d_2$ like this, then we know that when we refer to the digit $d_2$
that we are talking about the digit that is multiplied with $10^2$.

% \break
Let our five-digit-number $n$ use $d_0,d_1,d_2,d_3$ and $d_4$ for its digits. Then
the general expression for $n$ looks like this\footnote{That expression looks like
hard-core math, so let's take a moment
to read it out loud, as a Math-Professor might do in a lecture.  She might say:
``$n$ is equal to dee-four times ten-to-the-fourth, \dots{}
plus dee-three times ten-cubed, \dots{} plus dee-two times ten-squared,
  \dots{} plus dee-one times ten,  \dots{} plus dee-zero times one.''}:
\begin{align*}
n =\ &d_4{\cdot}10^4+d_3{\cdot}10^3+d_2{\cdot}10^2+d_1{\cdot}10^1+d_0{\cdot}10^0\text{, where}\\
& d_0\text{ is an integer such that }0\le{}d_0<10\text{, and}\\
& d_1\text{ is an integer such that }0\le{}d_1<10\text{, and}\\
& d_2\text{ is an integer such that }0\le{}d_2<10\text{, and}\\
& d_3\text{ is an integer such that }0\le{}d_3<10\text{, and}\\
& d_4\text{ is an integer such that }1\le{}d_4<10.
\end{align*}
OK, hold on a minute - that's getting a little cumbersome. it's clunky and hard to read -
plus did  you notice how we slipped in that different range for $d_4$?

First, let's deal with the different range on that $d_4$. To make sure $n$ is a
legitimate five-digit-number we have to
call out the exception that $d_4$ can NOT be zero - it has to be at least 1.
Why? Because if $d_4$ were zero then $n$ would only be a
four-digit-number, or perhaps a three-digit-number, or only two-digits etc.

Secondly, to clean up the presentation
a common convention
is to let another term like $i$, for perhaps ``index'', stand in for the subscript
when you want to talk about all your `$d$'s at once:
\begin{jprIn}
\begin{jprIn}
\begin{jprIn}
Let $d_0, d_1, d_2,d_3$ and $d_4$ be integers such that:

\hspace{3em}$n
=d_4{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^4
+d_3{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^3
+d_2{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^2
+d_1{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^1
+d_0{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^0$

where $0\le{}d_i<10$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and $d_4\ne0$.
\end{jprIn}
\end{jprIn}
\end{jprIn}
That's it! Those statements and the expression for $n$ describe EVERY five-digit-number.

Now let's extend
our five-digit-expression for $n$ to an arbitrary
number of digits.
Consider the following progression:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l}
expression for $n$ & number-of-digits\\
$d_0{\cdot}10^0$ & 1\\
$d_1{\cdot}10^1+d_0{\cdot}10^0$ & 2\\
$d_2{\cdot}10^2+d_1{\cdot}10^1+d_0{\cdot}10^0$ & 3\\
$d_3{\cdot}10^3+d_2{\cdot}10^2+d_1{\cdot}10^1+d_0{\cdot}10^0$ & 4\\
$d_4{\cdot}10^4+d_3{\cdot}10^3+d_2{\cdot}10^2+d_1{\cdot}10^1+d_0{\cdot}10^0$ & 5\\
\dots{} & \dots{}\\
$d_k{\cdot}10^k+\dots{}+d_4{\cdot}10^4+d_3{\cdot}10^3+d_2{\cdot}10^2+d_1{\cdot}10^1+d_0{\cdot}10^0$ & k+1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Using $k$ like this let's us specify any number of digits we want.
If we let $k=0$ we get the first ``single-digit'' 
item on the list.  $k=4$ gives us our five-digit-number above,
or we could let $k$ be a twenty-thousand, which would allow
us to specify an integer that has a twenty-thousand-and-one
digits in it.

%\break
So there we have it, we found our expression for being able to
express each positive integer, let's use
it in the final draft of our base-ten-theorem.

\section*{Base-Ten Representation Theorem}
\begin{jprIn}
Let the two-digit-number ``${1\hspace{-0.12em}0}$'' represent the integer ten.

For every positive integer $n$ there is a unique
sequence of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:

\hspace{3em}$n
=d_k{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^k
+d_{k-1}{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^{k-1}
+\dots
+d_2{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^2
+d_1{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^1
+d_0{\cdot}{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}^0$

where $0\le{}d_i<{1\hspace{-0.12em}0}$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-ten by the string of digits $d_kd_{k-1}{\cdots}d_2d_1d_0$
\end{jprIn}

% \emph{Base-Ten Representation Theorem (close to final draft)}
% \begin{jprIn}
% For every positive integer $n$ there is a unique sequence

% \end{jprIn}

Our newly added ``Definition'' introduces exactly what it means to write
the number out in base-ten; that is,
we toss out all the extraneous stuff from our expression
and string all the digits one after another.
Starting at the most-significant digit $d_k$ on the left,
down to the next digit to its right which is $d_{k-1}$
(read as ``dee-kay-minus-one''\footnote{\dots{}and $d_{k-1}$ is
multiplied by ``ten-to-the-power-of-(kay-minus-one)''.})
all the way down to the least-significant units-digit $d_0$ on the right.

I also threw in the opening statement
``Let the two-digit-number ``${1\hspace{-0.12em}0}$'' represent the integer ten''
since the theorem itself is defining what it even means to write out
a multiple digit number, so until this theorem is established, ``10'' could
mean anything.

% We are so darn close, but there is one super-picky detail
% that we should be concerned about.
% Our theorem establishes what it means to represent a number in base-ten, so until
% we've proven it, how can we actually use the first two-digit-number ``10'' to represent
% the integer ten!? We need a symbol for ten in the theorem,
% so what can we do?
% 
% Apart from ``10'' we don't have a symbol for the integer ten so
% we have to make one up, how about $T$ for ``Ten'':
% \begin{jprIn}
% Let $T$ represent the integer ten.
% 
% For every positive integer $n$ there is a unique sequence
% of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:
% 
% \hspace{3em}$n=d_k{\cdot}{T}^k+d_{k-1}{\cdot}{T}^{k-1}+\dots+d_2{\cdot}{T}^2+d_1{\cdot}{T}^1+d_0{\cdot}{T}^0$\\
% \dots{} etc.
% \end{jprIn}
% That's a little confusing, so 
% let's solve our problem by defining the 
% two-digit-number ``10'' (i.e., a one followed by a zero) to be the integer ten.
% It's OK - we're not violating any rules by doing this. At this point we're just defining
% a symbol to stand in for the integer ten. Here's our
% FINAL draft of the theorem:

\section*{Generalize the Theorem}

Since the introduction of the EDVAC\footnote{You might be thinking, don't you
mean ENIAC which was earlier? Actually no - the ENIAC
used base-ten accumulators, not binary!} computer, around 1950,
there have been many orders of magnitude more calculations done
in base-two (otherwise known as binary) by computers than have EVER
been done by people in base-ten for the entirety of human history.
This might even be true if we only count one-day's worth of
binary computer calculations - or perhaps even one-second's worth
of computer calculations across the whole world.
Anyway, now-a-days the use of base-two eclipses that of base-ten.

Binary-computer logic gates (the building blocks of the modern computer)
can only take one of two states, that is; ``off'' or ``on''.
We interpret these two states to represent these two numbers: 0 and 1.
By doing so, in the same way that base-ten uses ten numbers 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 for its digits, we can represent integers
in base-two with just the digits 0 and 1. How is this possible?

Consider distant Planet-Nova on which the emergent
intelligent species only have nine fingers on their hands.
They have three hands with three fingers each - anyway,
that's why they use base-nine, so they only need the numbers 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for their digits\footnote{Digit
is another word for finger! Of course,, that's where the math term got its start.}.
So like we Earthlings do for the integer ten,
instead of making up a new symbol for nine,
they use ``10'' to represent the integer nine - which
for them means ``One set of nine, plus zero units''.

Similarly on Planet-Ocho, since they only have eight fingers,
then they use base-eight and only use numbers 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for their digits. For them, ``10''
means ``One set of eight, plus zero units''.

On and on past Planet-Gary-Seven (they have only seven fingers),
and Planet-Hex (six fingers), Planet-Penta (five fingers), etc\dots{}

Finally, we come upon Planet-Claire (well someone
has to come from Planet-Claire,
I know she came from there),
where they only have two fingers
so they only use the digits 0 and 1 and base-two,
so for them, ``10'' means ``one set of two and zero units''.
So on Planet-Claire ``10'' means two.
Recall above how we arrived at our 100 in base-ten,
being ``ten sets of ten,
plus zero units'' - similarly on Planet-Claire ``100''
in base-two for them means ``Two sets of two plus zero units'' in other words,
four! What is ``11'' in base-two? Using our technique to
describe the digits we see that it's ``One set of two, plus one unit'',
in other words, three.

\break
Here's how they count on Planet-Claire using base-two:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l c r l}
base-two & base-ten & \; \; \; \; & base-two & base-ten\\
0 & 0 & \phantom& (\dots cont)\\
1 & 1 & \phantom& 1101 & 13\\
10 & 2 & \phantom& 1110 & 14\\
11 & 3 & \phantom& 1111 & 15\\
100 & 4 & \phantom& 10000 & 16\\
101 & 5 & \phantom& 10001 & 17\\
110 & 6 & \phantom& \dots{}\\
111 & 7 & \phantom& 11111 & 31\\
1000 & 8 & \phantom& 100000 & 32\\
1001 & 9 & \phantom& \dots{}\\
1010 & 10 & \phantom & 1000000 & 64\\
1011 & 11 & \phantom& 10000000 & 128\\
1100 & 12 (cont\dots) & \phantom& 100000000 & 256
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note something interesting in the list above - the powers of two,
written in base-two,
resemble our powers of 10 in base-ten! That is:
\begin{align*}
1 = 2^0&= 1, & 32 = 2^5&= 100000_{(\text{base-2})},\\
2 = 2^1&= 10_{(\text{base-2})}, & 64 = 2^6&= 1000000_{(\text{base-2})},\\
4 = 2^2&= 100_{(\text{base-2})}, & 128 = 2^7&= 10000000_{(\text{base-2})},\\
8 = 2^3&= 1000_{(\text{base-2})},& 256 = 2^8&= 100000000_{(\text{base-2})},\\
16 = 2^4&= 10000_{(\text{base-2})},& & \dots{}
\end{align*}
Let's look at the binary number 11010 for example.
Using our wordy technique to describe the number
we can see that it's ``One set of sixteen,
plus one set of eight, plus zero sets of four,
plus one set of two, plus zero units'': 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r r r r c r r l}
\phantom & 1 & $\times$ & 10000 & \phantom & \phantom & 10000 & (16)\\
+ & 1 & $\times$ & 1000 & \phantom & + & 1000 & (8)\\
+ & 0 & $\times$ & 100 & \; \; = \; \; & + & 000 & \\
+ & 1 & $\times$ & 10 & \phantom & + & 10 & (2)\\
+ & 0 & $\times$ & 1 & \phantom & + & 0\\
\cline{6-8}
\phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & \phantom & = & 11010 & (26)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Written in terms of powers of two:
$11010_{(\text{base-2})}=26=1\cdot2^4+1\cdot2^3+0\cdot2^2+1\cdot2^1+0\cdot2^0$.

Does that expression look familiar? It has exactly the same form
as the expression for our five-digit base-ten number 92507.
All the reasoning we used to come up with the statement of the ``Base-Ten
Representation Theorem'' can be used again, but swapping powers-of-two
for powers-of-ten, and limiting the values for the digits
to be zero or one.
Following our line of reasoning this is what the Planet-Claire mathematicians would have
come up with\dots

\break
\section*{Base-Two Representation Theorem}
\begin{jprIn}
For every positive integer $n$ there is a unique
sequence of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_k2^k+d_{k-1}2^{k-1}+\dots+d_22^2+d_12^1+d_02^0$,

where $0\le{}d_i<2$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-two by the string
of binary-digits $(d_kd_{k-1}{\cdots}d_2d_1d_0)_2$
\end{jprIn}
\bigskip

Our new Base-Two Representation Theorem introduced some helpful new notation in the ``Definition''.
How do you know what I'm talking about if I just
write ``1000''? Do I mean $10^3$ or $2^3$?
If there is any possibility for confusion we write
the number like this $(1000)_{10}$ 
for the base-ten version meaning one-thousand and $(1000)_2$
for the binary version meaning eight.
That's what the ``Definition'' is spelling out with the ``$(\dots)_2$'' notation.

As is hinted by the habits of our various alien friends
above it seems that we can use ANY integer greater than
or equal to 2 as a base.
In fact computer graphics artists are known
to stumble upon numbers written in hexadecimal (usually relating to specifying a color-channel),
which is base-sixteen.

Base-sixteen introduces some new single-character symbols to the usual numbers 0, 1,
2, thru 9,
to represent the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
Base-sixteen adds the digits A, B, C, D, E and F where
A\textsubscript{16}=(10)\textsubscript{10},
B\textsubscript{16}=(11)\textsubscript{10},
C\textsubscript{16}=(12)\textsubscript{10},
D\textsubscript{16}=(13)\textsubscript{10},
E\textsubscript{16}=(14)\textsubscript{10},
F\textsubscript{16}=(15)\textsubscript{10}.
For example, (97A3F2)\textsubscript{16} is a four-digit-number in base-sixteen
(which means (9,937,906)\textsubscript{10} in base-ten.)

Note that if we omit the parentheses and subscript from a number,
it means we're talking about it in base-ten; our ``default'' base.
Case in point: the subscripts that we use to denote the base
(like the ``16'' in (97A3F2)\textsubscript{16}) are written in base-ten.

We could go ahead and prove our ``Base-Ten'' and ``Base-Two'' theorems above,
but what about proving the ``Base-Nine'' version of the theorem for the aliens on Planet-Nova,
or the ``Base-Eight'' version for the inhabitants of Planet-Ocho?

To cover all bases (pun intended) let's restate our theorem for the general case,
call it ``base-$b$'',
where $b$ is some number greater than or equal to two.
If we can prove that theorem,
then we'll automatically get all the cases of specific bases for free.

Here is our hero-theorem again, but this time, armed with your new mathematical 
vocabulary and
understanding I expect that this theorem will make much more sense to you.

\section*{Basis Representation Theorem}
\begin{jprIn}
Let $b$ be a positive integer greater than 1.

For every positive integer $n$ there is a unique sequence
of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0$,

where $0\le{}d_i<b$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.

Definition: $n$ is represented in base-$b$ by the string
of base-$b$-digits $(d_kd_{k-1}{\cdots}d_2d_1d_0)_b$
\end{jprIn}
\bigskip

So to get the ``Base-Ten Representation Theorem'' let $b$ equal ten.
To get the ``Base-Two Representation Theorem'' let $b=2$; or the ``Base-Nine Representation Theorem''
let $b=9$; etc.

Recall how we defined $(\text{A})_{16}=10$
and $(\text{F})_{16}=15$ as base-sixteen digits, then:
\[
(\text{97A3F2})_{16}
=9\cdot{}16^5
+7\cdot{}16^4
+10\cdot{}16^3
+3\cdot{}16^2
+15\cdot{}16^1
+2\cdot{}16^0
=9,937,906\]
\dots{}which gives you an idea of how you can convert from an alternate base into base-ten.

Before we dive into proving the theorem please try some exercises for fun.
Mathematics is more enjoyable if you get your hands dirty, it's not
just a spectator sport.
You should be able to do these exercises but if you get stuck (or to
check your work) the
answers are supplied below - but please don't peek until you try the questions yourself.

If you feel bewildered when facing the exercises, know that you are in good
company - this is a common feeling among mathematicians, you'll get used to it.
But like any exercise in a workout if you push on through you will get stronger.
(Hint: A pocket calculator will be helpful.)

\item 33 expressed in base-two?
\item 127 expressed in base-two? (Hint: $127 = (128-1)$)
\item 8079 expressed in base-sixteen?

Hint: For a moment, pretend that we don't use base-ten to
write out our numbers, instead picture a pile of apples.
Can you picture 7654 apples?  Yes?  Good let's use 7654 as our example.

Let's divide 7654 by 10 so we get the following:
\[7654 = 765\cdot{}10+4\]
Notice the remainder 4 is the least-significant-digit of our
integer 7654  (i.e. the $d_0$ digit in the theorem).

How do we get the next digit, i.e. the $d_1$ digit that corresponds to the $10^1$ term? Well, its kind of cheating, but
since we happen to be looking at that last expression written in
base-ten we can see it sitting right there in at the
end of the quotient ``765''. So, let's use the same technique and divide 765 by 10:
\[765 = 76\cdot{}10+5\]
So the remainder is 5 our $d_1$ digit.  Let's keep going, this time dividing the previous quotient 76 by 10.\dots	
\[76 = 7\cdot{}10+6\]
and finally,
\[7= 0\cdot{}10+7\]
So, our series of remainders happens to be the digits of the number in base-ten.
Specifically $d_3 = 7$, $d_2=6$, $d_1=5$ and $d_0=4$.

Try doing that for 8079, but use 16 instead of 10 as the divisor.
\item Let $\text{A}_{23} = 10, \text{B}_{23} = 11, \text{C}_{23} = 12, \text{D}_{23} = 13, \text{E}_{23} = 14, \text{F}_{23} = 15,

\section*{Introduction to Proofs}

There are several ways to approach
proving The Basis Representation Theorem.

The mathematician George E. Andrews (in his book
``Number Theory'') has an interesting approach.
He asks us to imagine a that we have at our disposal a function that when fed a positive integer $n$,
returns to us a count of the number of base-$b$ representations of $n$.
Then with some fairly straightforward reasoning he shows that this counting-function
MUST produce a count of ``1'' for every $n$, both establishing the uniqueness 
and the existence in one fell swoop.

We could also prove The Basis Representation Theorem by dividing our integer $n$ by $b$, then dividing that
result by $b$ again, then again, and again, etc. We'd end up with a finite-length sequence
of remainders would be the base-$b$-digits of $n$.
This approach is a
generalization how we solved
exercise number 2-iii above.

However, we're going to use
the principle of mathematical induction directly on $n$
to prove that
a base-$b$ representation of each positive integer exists.
Then we'll use a different approach to prove that each such representation is unique.

\section*{The Principle of Mathematical Induction}

Recall that
when we talk about positive integers in mathematics, we're talking about
the set of numbers that
represent successively larger piles of apples starting
with a pile containing only one apple.
So we start with
``\faApple{}'' to get our very first
smallest pile of apples.
Then add another apple to get a pile of ``\faApple{}\faApple{}'',
then ``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}'',
then ``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}''
then some big pile of
``\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\dots{}\faApple{}\faApple{}\faApple{}''
after we've been adding apples for a while.
Each successively bigger pile of apples corresponds with each successive positive integer.
We keep adding one more to get the next integer, we keep adding one more,
over and over forever to get them all.

% That is, each successive integer is one more than the previous one,
% starting at 1, then one more
% taking us to 2,
% then 3, 4, 5, \dots{}ad~infinitum\footnote{``ad
% infinitum'' means ``to infinity'', or ``continue forever, without limit''.}.

This idea of being able to step one after the other,
beginning at 1 and going forever is embodied within the principle of mathematical
induction and is a basic property of the positive integers.
This principle is more than just a way to generate the set of integers,
it's also a way of thinking about properties of the integers.

Suppose
that $P(n)$ means that the property $P$ holds
for the number $n$; where $n$ is a positive integer.
Then the principle of mathematical induction states that $P(n)$
is true for ALL positive integers $n$ provided that\footnote{This wording of the
definition of ``The Principle of Mathematical Induction'' is essentially borrowed
from ``Calculus'' by Michael Spivak - a fabulous introductory textbook on Analysis.}:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $P(1)$ is true
\item Whenever $P(k)$ is true, $P(k+1)$ is true.
\end{enumerate}

Why would these two conditions show that $P(n)$ is true for all
positive integers? Note that condition ii) only asserts the truth
of $P(k+1)$ under the assumption that $P(k)$ is true.
However, if we also know that $P(1)$ is true then condition ii) implies that $P(2)$ is true,
which again implies that $P(3)$ is true,
which in turn leads to the truth of $P(4)$,
etc., over and over for all positive integers.

Some people picture an infinite row of dominoes.
Having condition i) (called the ``base case'') is like being
able to knock over the first domino.
Then knowing that condition ii) is also true (called the ``induction step'') is like the
fact that any one domino has the ability to knock over the next.
Once you've knocked over the first domino,
they all fall.

Let's look at a simple example:
Perhaps you've heard the story of young Carl Friedrich Gauss
as a boy in
the 1780s who was assigned (along with all his classmates)
the tedious task of summing the first 100 integers -
presumably to keep them quiet and busy while the
teacher corrected some papers. Anyway,
young Gauss immediately produced the answer,
5050, before most of the boys had summed the first couple of numbers.

It wasn't young Gauss's extraordinary computational speed which allowed
him to perform this dazzling task,
but he had the deeper insight that instead of adding 1 plus 2,
then adding 3, then 4, etc.
he saw that if you paired 1 with 100,
and 2 with 99,
and 3 with 98,
etc.,
that each of those pairs added up to 101,
furthermore he knew he'd have 50 such pairs,
meaning he could state the result in a heartbeat - tada - ``5050''!
Gauss is widely regarded as being one of the greatest
mathematicians who have ever lived - the young eight-year-old was just getting started.

Anyway,
to generalize young Gauss's insight we can write the expression like this:
\[1+2+3+\ldots+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\]
So let's prove this relationship using the principle of mathematical induction.
\bigskip

Let $n=1$ to establish the ``base case'',
then
\[\frac{1(1+1)}{2}=\frac{2}{2}=1\]
Which is the trivial sum\footnote{The word ``sum'' here is used
in the context of the expression
we are trying to prove. In this case we are summing
only one item thus it's ``trivial''.} of the first positive integer 1.
%\bigskip

Now for our ``induction step'': We assume the relationship is true for $n=k$; that is,
\[1+2+3+\ldots+k=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\]
and prove that it must also be true
for $n=k+1$; that is, we need to show that,
\[1+2+3+\ldots+k+(k+1)=\frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}\]
Which we do on the next page by simply out by writing out the sum from 1 to \(k+1\), then
start to work with what we've got and see where it leads.

\begin{alignat*}{2}
&(1+2+3+\ldots+k) + (k+1) \;\;  &&\text{(Add together 1 through }k+1\text{.)}\\
=\ &\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) &&\text{(Substitute induction assumption for 1 through }k\text{.)}\\
=\ &\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2} &&\text{(Common denominator of 2.)}\\
=\ &\frac{k^2+k+2k+2}{2} &&\text{(Multiply out numerator.)}\\
=\ &\frac{k^2+3k+2}{2} &&\text{(Add like terms.)}\\
=\ &\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} &&\text{(Factor numerator.)}\\
=\ &\frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2} &&\text{(Rewrite in terms of }(k+1)\text{.)}
\end{alignat*}
Which proves young Gauss's expression is true for
the positive integer $n = k+1$ whenever it's true for $n = k$; so
by the principle of mathematical induction,
the expression is true for all positive integers. QED\footnote{``QED'' - is
often used at the conclusion of a proof to state that it's
done - it's an acronym for the Latin phrase
``quod erat demonstrandum'' which means ``that which was to be demonstrated''.
In other words, we've proven what we set out to prove.}

\section*{Idea behind Induction Proof for the Basis-Reprn-Thm}
Using the
principle of mathematical induction 
to prove that a base-$b$ number exists for all the positive integers is pretty simple.
The crux of the approach is to show that if $n$ can be expressed in base-$b$,
then it necessarily follows that $n+1$ can also be represented in base-$b$.

Let's pretend we just bought a brand-new car with one of those physical odometers that
spin little wheels to show the number of miles driven. According
to the brochure our new car has a magic-odometer.
We notice as we
pull out of the dealership parking lot that
the odometer is only one digit wide and
that one-and-only-digit displays a ``1'', I guess the factory was only one mile away.

As we get close to the end of our drive home
we see we've clocked 9 miles.
Naturally we're a little curious about how it's going to
count to ten since the odometer apparently only has one digit.
While pondering this curiosity we see the 9 starting to roll
over back to 0, and a second digit to it's left magically materializes!
It rolls to a 1 as the 9 settles back to 0.
Apparently this magic-odometer only adds new digits to the left
as it needs them.
The magic-odometer should be able to display ANY number of miles, no matter how large.

\break
Our proof is going to take care of the three cases that happen with
the magic-odometer. Imagine that we've already driven some arbitrarily large
number of miles, and we're watching the odometer roll over to the
next mile. We have the following cases:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item The units-digit is less than 9, so driving one more mile only increments
the units-digit, not affecting any of the other digits.

Example: We've driven 782995 miles so far, so the next mile driven is
$782995 + 1 = 782996$.

So that units-digit turned from a ``5'' to a ``6'', all the rest of
the digits remaining unchanged,
so the new number is a legitimate base-ten number.
\item The units-digit, and perhaps a few directly to the left of it, are all 9's,
so driving one more mile will spin all those 9's to 0,
at the same time incrementing
the rightmost-digit \emph{that isn't a} 9 by one.

Example: We've driven 782999 miles so far, so the next mile driven is:
\begin{align*}
782999+1 &= 780000+2000+999+1\\
&=780000+2000+(1000-1)+1\\
&=780000+2000+1000+(-1+1)\\
&=780000+3000+0\\
&=783000
\end{align*}
That looks overly complicated, but I broke it down
like that to demonstrate the idea behind the algebra that's
used in the actual proof.

Anyway, it's clear that the rightmost-digit that-isn't-a-9, in our case the 2, got changed
to a 3 and all the 9's got changed to 0's, while the rest of the digits remained unchanged
leaving us with a legitimate base-ten number.
\item ALL the digits from the units-digit up to the highest-digit are 9's,
so driving one more mile
engages the magic-odometer feature, materializing a new leftmost-digit.
The newly materialized digit turns to a 1 and all the 9's spin back to 0.
In this case the number of digits on the odometer will have been extended by one.

Example: We've driven 999999 miles so far, so the next mile driven is:
\begin{align*}
999999+1 &=(1000000-1)+1\\
&=1000000+(-1+1)\\
&=1000000+0\\
&=1000000
\end{align*}
This uses the same kind of algebraic manipulation as the previous case, but this time our number grew from a
six-digit-number to a seven-digit-number. Yup, we just drove a million miles
which is definitely a legitimate base-ten number.
\end{enumerate}

Without further adieu, let's get to the actual proof!

\break
\section*{Existence Proof of the Basis Representation Theorem}
Let $b$ be a positive integer greater than 1.

Using induction we will show that for every positive integer $n$ there is a sequence
of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0$,

where $0\le{}d_i<b$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.

We will henceforth refer to the above expression for $n$ as the
``base-$b$-representation'' for $n$.

\bigskip
Base case:
\begin{jprIn}
Consider when $n=1$.

Let $d_0=1$ be the only integer in the sequence.  Then,

\hspace{3em}$d_0b^0=1\cdot{}b^0=1\cdot{}1=1=n$

Since $d_0<b$ and $d_0\ne0$ (note: $k=0$) then this
shows that a 
base-$b$-representation exists for the integer 1.
\end{jprIn}

\bigskip
Induction Step:
\begin{jprIn}
Let $n$ be a positive integer, and assume that
there is a sequence
of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:

\hspace{3em}$n=d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0$,

where $0\le{}d_i<b$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.

We will prove that $n+1$ also has a
base-$b$-representation by looking at two cases.

Case 1) $d_0<(b-1)$
\begin{jprIn}
This case examines when the least-significant-digit
of $n$ is \emph{strictly-less-than} the largest value it can take in base-$b$.
(For example, in base-two $d_0 = 0$;
In base-five $d_0\le{}3$;
In base-ten $d_0\le{}8$.)\footnote{Please read the following
bidirectional arrow symbol $\Leftrightarrow$
as ``if and only if'' - it's like a logical ``equals'' sign}
%\footnote{Use
%the axiom of Distribution \big(i.e.; $ac+bc=(a+b)c$\big) to factor out the $b^0$ below.}
{\small
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &&n
  &= d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0 &&\quad\text{(Induction Assumption)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &n+1
  &= d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0 + 1 &&\quad\text{(Add 1 to both sides)}\\  
  &&&= d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0 + b^0 &&\quad\text{(Restate 1 as }b^0\text{)}\\
  &&&= d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1 + (d_0+1)b^0 &&\quad\text{(Axiom of Distribution)}
\end{alignat*}
}The expression for $n+1$ uses the same sequence of
integers $d_k, d_{k-1},\dots{},d_2,d_1$ as $n$, with only
change being that the integer $d_0$ was altered to $(d_0{+}1)$, but since:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &&d_0
  &< (b-1) &&\quad\text{(Case 1 Assumption)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &d_0+1
  &< (b-1)+1 &&\quad\text{(Add 1 to both sides)}\\  
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &d_0+1
  &< b
\end{alignat*}
Therefore, given the conditions of ``Case 1'', $n+1$ has a base-$b$-representation whenever $n$ does.
\end{jprIn}

\bigskip
Case 2) $d_0=(b-1)$
\begin{jprIn}
Now we'll look at the case when the least-significant-digit of $n$ is \emph{exactly-equal-to}
the largest value it can take in base-$b$.
%(Note that  ``Case 1'' and ``Case 2'' cover all the possibilities for what $d_0$ can be.)
(For example, in base-two
$d_0=1$; in base-five
$d_0=4$; in base-ten $d_0=9$.)

We're going to split this case into two cases.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item \emph{All} the digits of $n$ are equal-to $b{-}1$ (eg. 999999 in base-ten).
\item $d_0=(b-1)$ but \emph{at least one other} digit is not-equal-to $(b-1)$\\
(eg. 782999 in base-ten).
\end{enumerate}
%
%Then we're going to find out what happens when we add 1 to each case, thus giving us our
%resultant expression for $n+1$

Case 2a) ALL of the digits of $n$ are equal to $(b-1)$.
\begin{jprIn}
So $n$ can be expressed like this:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &\quad&n
  &= (b{-}1)b^k+\dots{}+(b{-}1)b^2+(b{-}1)b^1+(b{-}1)b^0 &&\quad\text{(Induction Assumption)}
\end{alignat*}
Recall in the ``Extra Exercise: Geometric Series Theorem''
we showed that:
\[1+b+b^2+\dots{}+b^k=\frac{b^{k+1}-1}{b-1}\]

We can use this theorem to show that $n+1=b^{k+1}$ as follows\dots
\smallskip
{\small
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &&b^k+\dots{}+b^2+b+1
  &= \frac{b^{k+1}-1}{b-1} &&\quad\text{(Reorder terms of G.S.Thm.)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &b^k+\dots{}+b^2+b^1+b^0
  &= \frac{b^{k+1}-1}{b-1} &&\quad\text{(Rewrite with }b^1, b^0\text{)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &(b-1)(b^k+\dots{}+b^2+b^1+b^0)
  &= b^{k+1}-1 &&\quad\text{(Mult both side by }(b{-}1)\text{)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &(b{-}1)b^k+\dots{}+(b{-}1)b^1+(b{-}1)b^0
  &= b^{k+1}-1 &&\quad\text{(Distribution of }(b{-}1)\text{)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &n
  &= b^{k+1}-1 &&\quad\text{(Substitute }n\text{ for expression)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &n+1
  &= b^{k+1} &&\quad\text{(Add 1 to both sides)}
\end{alignat*}
}Let's rewrite $n+1$:
\[n+1= 1\cdot{}b^{k+1}+0\cdot{}b^{k}+\dots{}+0\cdot{}b^2+0\cdot{}b^1+0\cdot{}b^0,\]
Therefore, given the conditions of ``case 2a'', $n+1$ has
a valid base-$b$-representation whenever $n$ does.
We note that
the number of integers in the sequence associated
with $n+1$ is one longer than for $n$. i.e., $n+1$ is one digit longer that $n$.

\end{jprIn}
Case 2b) $d_0=(b-1)$ but at least one other digit is not equal to $(b-1)$
\begin{jprIn}
Let $j$ be the lowest power-of-$b$ such that $d_j<(b{-}1)$,
i.e.; we can write $n$ as follows:
\[n = d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_jb^j+(b{-}1)b^{j-1}+\dots+(b{-}1)b^1+(b{-}1)b^0\]
Similar to how we used the ``Geometric Series Theorem'' above,
we can simplify the expression for $n$ as follows:
{\small
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &&n
  &= d_kb^k+\dots+d_jb^j+\big((b{-}1)b^{j-1}+\dots+(b{-}1)b^1+(b{-}1)b^0\big)&&\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &n
  &= d_kb^k+\dots+d_jb^j+(b^j-1) &&\text{(Geom. Series Thm.)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &n+1
  &=  d_kb^k+\dots+d_jb^j+b^j &&\text{(Add 1 to both sides)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &n+1
  &=  d_kb^k+\dots+(d_j+1)b^j &&\text{(Distr Axiom)}
\end{alignat*}
}Rewriting the expression for $n$ in explicit terms:
\[n+1= d_kb^k+\dots+d_{j+1}b^{j+1}+(d_j+1)b^j+0{\cdot{}}{}b^{j-1}+\dots{}+0{\cdot{}}b^1+0{\cdot{}}b^0\]
We can see that the expression for $n+1$ uses the same
sequence of integers $d_k,\dots{},d_{j+1}$ as $n$.
The integer $d_j$ was altered to $(d_j{+}1)$, which is a valid digit since:
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  &&d_j
  &< (b-1) &&\quad\text{(Previous assumption)}\\
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &d_j+1
  &< (b-1)+1 &&\quad\text{(Add 1 to both sides)}\\  
  &\Leftrightarrow\quad
  &d_j+1
  &< b
\end{alignat*}
Furthermore the remaining sequence of integers $d_{j-1}=\dots{}=d_2=d_1=d_0=0$.

Therefore, given the conditions of ``case 2b'', $n+1$ has
a valid base-$b$-representation whenever $n$ does.
\end{jprIn}
\end{jprIn}
Taking ``Case 1'' and ``Case 2'' together proves that $n+1$
always has a base-$b$-representation whenever $n$ does.
Having also established the base-case, therefore by the principle of mathematical induction
all positive integers have a base-$b$-representation.

QED
\end{jprIn}

\section*{Idea behind Uniqueness Proof for the Basis-Reprn-Thm}
Even though we can use induction to prove the existence of base-$b$
numbers for every integer, let's think about why it
doesn't prove the ``uniqueness'' aspect of 
the theorem.
Imagine a magic-box
that also makes base-$b$ representations for each
integer.
In other words, if the odometer is the principle-of-mathematical-induction then the magic-box
is some different mechanism working in a different way.
Why not? We weren't careful to show that induction is the ONLY way
to generate a base-$b$ representation for each number. (It isn't.)

So we need to prove that if such a magic-box exists then it MUST
produce the same results as our odometer.

The easiest way to prove this is to assume that there is a magic-box
that DOES NOT produce the same representation as our odometer, then we show that
this assumption leads to an irreconcilable contradiction.
So either our assumption is wrong or the axioms are.
Since we're VERY confident in the axioms being correct we can only 
conclude that our assumption must be wrong - meaning
that there is only \emph{one} way 
to make a base-$b$ representation for each integer.

In order to proceed, we
need to make use of a well-established theorem
called the ``Euclidean Division Theorem''.
It sounds onerous, but don't worry, you learned it
in the third grade when you learned how to divide.
It simply states the following\dots{}

\break
\section*{Euclidean Division Theorem}
\begin{jprIn}
For all integers $a$ and $b$ such that $b>0$,
there exist \emph{unique} integers $q$ and $r$ such that\footnote{Aside:
Actually the theorem is stronger than we have stated here.
Specifically, it only requires that $b\ne0$, however,
to keep the remainder positive, the restriction on $r$
would have to be stated like
this $0\le{}r<\left|b\right|$ to deal with
the possibility that $b$ might be negative.}:
\[a=qb+r  \text{ such that } 0\le{}r<b\]
Definition: In the above equation:
\begin{jprIn}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
a is the \emph{dividend} & (``the number being divided'')\\
b is the \emph{divisor} & (``the number doing the dividing'')\\
q is the \emph{quotient} & (``the result of the division'')\\
r is the \emph{remainder} & (``the leftover'')
\end{tabular}
\end{jprIn}
\end{jprIn}
This is how you first learned to divide.
For example, if someone asks you ``What is nineteen divided by three?'', you'd
answer ``six with one remaining''. Here 19 is the \emph{dividend},  3 is the \emph{divisor},
6 is the \emph{quotient} and 1 is the \emph{remainder}. Written in the form of the theorem:
\[19=6\cdot3+1\]
Often proofs make use of little mini-theorems of their own.
Creating these mini-theorems is a way to simplify a step in
the main proof by establishing a useful
intermediary result. It makes reading the main proof
easier to follow by not having us get sidetracked with
the technicalities of a step we want to make.
These mini-theorems are called ``Lemmas''.
We're going to make a lemma to help with proving the uniqueness part
of the Basis Representation Theorem. But first we're going to make use of the
Euclidean Division Theorem to prove our lemma.

\section*{Lemma}
\begin{jprIn}
Let $b, q$ and $r$ be integers such that $b>0$ and $0\le{}r<b$, then:
\begin{center}
$0=qb+r$ 
\hspace{1.5em}if and only if\hspace{1.5em}
$q=0$ and $r=0$.
\end{center}
\end{jprIn}

\section*{Proof of Lemma}
\begin{jprIn}
Let $b, q$ and $r$ be integers such that $b>0$ and $0\le{}r<b$.

If $q=0$ and $r=0$, then \\
\hphantom{2em}$qb+r=0\cdot{}b+0=0$

Also if $0=qb+r$, then
clearly
$q=0$ and $r=0$ satisfy the equation,
but by the constraints
placed on the values for $b$ and $r$, then the Euclidean Division Theorem tells us
that $q$ and $r$ are unique, therefore 
$q=0$ and $r=0$ is the only solution to this equation.

\section*{Uniqueness Proof of the Basis Representation Theorem}

Let $b$ be a positive integer greater than 1.

By the ``Existence Proof of the Basis Representation Theorem'' we know
that for every positive integer $n$ there is a sequence
of integers $d_0, d_1, d_2,\dots{},d_k$ such that:
\begin{jprIn}
$n=d_kb^k+d_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b^0$, where\\
\hphantom{2em}$0\le{}d_i<b$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $d_k\ne0$.
\end{jprIn}

Assume this expression for $n$ is not unique and that there also exists
a different sequence
of integers $c_0, c_1, c_2,\dots{},c_k$ such that:
\begin{jprIn}
$n=c_kb^k+c_{k-1}b^{k-1}+\dots+c_2b^2+c_1b^1+c_0b^0$, where\\
\hphantom{2em}where $0\le{}c_i<b$ for all $i$ in $\{0,1,2,\dots{},k\}$ and $c_k\ne0$.
\end{jprIn}

Let's further suppose that $j$ is the lowest power such that the integers $d_j\ne{}c_j$ and without any loss of generality
let's assume that $d_j>c_j$. Since both expressions are equal to $n$ then:
\begin{center}
$c_kb^k+\dots+c_2b^2+c_1b^1+c_0b^0=d_kb^k+\dots+d_2b^2+d_1b^1+d_0b,$

  &&0
  &= (d_k-c_k)b^k+\dots+(d_j-c_j)b^j&&\quad\text{(Subtract left-side from both-sides)}\\

\end{alignat*}
}

Let $q=\big((d_k-c_k)b^{k-j-1}+\dots+(d_{j+1}-c_{j+1})\big)$, then
\[0=qb+(d_j-c_j)\]
Since $0\le(d_j-c_j)<b$ and $b>0$ then by our lemma we know that
$q=0$ and $d_j-c_j = 0$.

But $d_j-c_j = 0$ if and only if $d_j = c_j$
contradicting our assumption that $d_j\ne{}c_j$. This implies that the initial assumption that ``$n$
is not unique'' is \emph{false}, in other words:
\begin{center}
The base-$b$ representation of $n$ is unique.\\
QED

\bigskip
Since we have proven that a base-$b$-representation exists for ALL the positive integers \emph{and}
that this representation is unique, then we
have proven the Basis Representation Theorem.

\section*{Epilogue}

I wrote this paper with a technically savvy audience in mind, namely the many talented visual effects artists
that I've worked with over the years who mainly graduated from Art College. Since Art College doesn't
usually place an emphasis on higher level mathematics these younger artists may not have been exposed to
it - and yet they use tools on a daily basis that are essentially high-level math applications.

If that describes you, then
my hope with the paper is that by
taking a familiar and simple subject, like counting, and applying rigorous mathematical reasoning,
that you will become familiar with its ``language'' and get a taste for the
sharpness of the thought process. Most importantly I hope
you found some amusement in and among the mathematical tidbits sprinkled here
and there.

I know you are very sensitive to beauty, after all, you are an artist
so my hope is to open one more avenue to you to appreciate 
the beauty that mathematics has to offer, which rivals and perhaps eclipses any
musical composition or painting or sculpture.

I don't claim that this particular paper contains such beauty (well, the Geometric Series Theorem is pretty
elegant and nifty) but being comfortable with the language of mathematics will at least allow
you to get to some of those marvelous results. I suggest Googling ``Taylor Series'' and ``Maclaurin Series''
which now that you are a little more comfortable with reading ``mathy'' statements, it might
begin to make sense reading a wiki page.

Following that thread will take you to an amazing place, one the connects the trigonometric functions
like sine and cosine with the natural logarithm in totally unexpected ways. Those mathematical
discoveries point to some deep simple structure that underlies our world that without mathematics
you wouldn't get to glimpse. It is truly awe-inspiring to experience for the first time - enjoy!
