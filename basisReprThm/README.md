# Basis Representation Theorem
This directory contains the current up-to-date and working copy
of James Philip Rowell's paper entitled "Counting"; the tex
source of which is the file:

    basisReprThm.tex,

which has been TeXed and typset into the file:

    basisReprThm.pdf.

Use "git log --follow basisRepnThm.pdf" (for example) to get a
complete log of changes to these files, as a name change
using "git mv" was made at one point preventing typical
access to older revisions.

There were two earlier drafts (with revisions each) of this paper
over a two year period beginning around Nov 9, 2016. These are
contained in the subdirectories, draft01 and draft02.

draft01 contains only .pdf exports from the original "Google Doc"
versions of the paper, which still live in jrowellfx's google-docs
drive. The files are called "baseTheoremV02", ..., "baseTheoremV15".
(v01 of this document was nothing worth keeping, as it was a MS Word
Document and had very little of value in it.)

Due to frustration with trying to get Google-Docs to perform in a 
satisfactory manner (esp wrt typesetting Mathematics), this lead to
the last file "baseTheorem15" becoming the starting point transcribing
it into .tex - and me (James Rowell) learning TeX.

So draft02 contains a continuation of the Google-Docs paper, but
rewritten in TeX.
